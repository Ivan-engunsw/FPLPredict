# FPLPredict
## Soccer Match Outcome Prediction with Soft Voting Ensemble

This project implements a **machine learning model** to predict soccer match outcomes using a **soft voting ensemble** of four base estimators: Random Forest, XGBoost, SVC, and Logistic Regression.

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple models using soft voting for improved accuracy and robustness.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Generates meaningful features from historical match data to boost predictive performance.  
- **Web Scraping**: Automatically collects soccer data from online sources using **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup**.  
- **Evaluation**: Uses metrics like **accuracy** and **log loss** to assess performance, with a focus on multi-class outcomes (Win, Loss, Draw).  

This project demonstrates the integration of **data collection, feature engineering, and ensemble modeling** to tackle real-world predictive tasks in sports analytics.
